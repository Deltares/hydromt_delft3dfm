  #TODO: this does not work since the rastered sample dataset is coordinate converted, but lat/lon remain 1d and this is passed to gridded samples
  #it does work with ravelled samples (incl converted coordinates) with a direct meshkernel implementation: build_2dmodel_coastal_meshkernel_issue.py
  #discuss how to proceed: gridded or ravelled samples
  #mesh refinement algorithm is different for these two sample sets: https://github.com/Deltares/MeshKernelPy/issues/71
