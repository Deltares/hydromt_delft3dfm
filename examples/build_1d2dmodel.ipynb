    "\n",
    "- [global](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.html#hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel): our model will be defined in the projected CRS WGS84 EPSG 3857.\n",
    "- [setup_rivers_from_dem](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_rivers_from_dem.html): we will derive the 1D rivers lines based on the *MERIT Hydro DEM* and that intersects with the region bounding box [12.4331, 46.4661, 12.5212, 46.5369]. River roughness will be a Manning constant of 25.0 and we will use data from *rivers_lin2019* database to prepare rectangular cross-sections. Other default parameters are read from rivers_defaults data.\n",
    "- [setup_pipes](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_pipes.html): we will add pipes by assuming that they are located under the roads as defined in the *grip_roads* data. Roughness will be a WhiteColeBrook constant of 0.003 and we will use a circular cross-sections of 0.5m. The pipes invert levels will be derived from the *MERIT Hydro DEM* assuming a constant depth of the pipe underground of 2 meters. Other default parameters are read from pipes_defaults data.\n",
    "- [setup_manholes](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_manholes.html): for a dflowfm model to be valid, if pipes are defined, then the corresponding should be added as well (careful of the order, setup_manholes can only be called after all elements of the network have been prepared, ie setup_pipes, setup_rivers and/or setup_rivers_from_dem and/or setup_channels). Here we do not have specific input data locations for our pipes, so manholes will be generated based on a set of standards specified in manhole_defaults_fn.\n",
    "- [setup_1dboundary](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_1dboundary.html): finally as a default, we will initialise the upstream and downstream boundaries of our rivers with a constant waterlevel of -2.0 meter a.s.l\n",
    "- [setup_mesh2d](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_mesh2d.html): we will prepare a regular grid for the region bounding box [12.4331, 46.4661, 12.5212, 46.5369] of 500*500 meters resolution.\n",
    "- [setup_maps_from_rasterdataset](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_maps_from_rasterdataset.html): prepares gridded elevation from *merit_hydro*. Here elevation is only extracted from *merit_hydro* and later the Delft3D FM kernel will interpolate it to the mesh 2D grid using the *nearestNb* method.\n",
    "- [setup_maps_from_raster_reclass](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_maps_from_raster_reclass.html): prepares gridded Manning roughness and infiltration capacity data by reclassifying the landuse categories in *vito* landuse data, using parameters values defined per landuse category in *vito_mapping* table. When running, the Delft3D FM kernel will interpolate it to the mesh 2D grid using the *triangulation* method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionnally to a 1D or 2D models only, we have now added a new method:\n",

    "- [setup_link1d2d](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_link1d2d.html): we will link our 1D and 2D mesh by setting up links from the 1D network to the 2D grid. As you can imagine, this function can only be run once both the schematisation of the 1D and the 2D grids are finalized. If any change is made to the 1D or the 2D grid, this funcion should be run again.\n",
