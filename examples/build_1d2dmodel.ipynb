    "- [global](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.html#hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel): Our model will be defined in the projected CRS WGS84 EPSG 3857. TO ensure the 1D network is connected, we will allow snapping of 25 meters using argument network_snap_offset. The 1D computational grid for the open water system will be created at 40 meters distance using argument openwater_computation_node_distance. \n",

    "- [setup_rivers_from_dem](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_rivers_from_dem.html): We will derive the 1D rivers lines based on the *MERIT Hydro DEM* and that intersects with the region bounding box [12.4331, 46.4661, 12.5212, 46.5369]. River roughness will be a Manning constant of 25.0 and we will use data from *rivers_lin2019* database to prepare rectangular cross-sections. \n",
    "- [setup_pipes](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_pipes.html): We will add pipes by assuming that they are located under the roads, with a standard length of 50 meters. The roads are defined in the *grip_roads* data and the standard length are defined in the argument spacing. Roughness will be a WhiteColeBrook constant of 0.003 and we will use a circular cross-sections of 0.5m. The pipes invert levels will be derived from the *MERIT Hydro DEM* assuming a constant depth of the pipe underground of 2 meters. \n",
    "- [setup_manholes](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_manholes.html): For a pipe network, manholes are present at pipe connections. Here we do not have specific input data locations for our pipes, so manholes will be generated based on a set of standards specified in manhole_defaults_fn.\n",
    "- [setup_1dboundary](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_1dboundary.html): Finally as a default, we will apply both upstream and downstream boundaries of our rivers with a constant waterlevel of -2.0 meter a.s.l\n",

    "- [setup_mesh2d](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_mesh2d.html): we will prepare a regular grid for the region bounding box [12.4331, 46.4661, 12.5212, 46.5369] of *500***500* meters resolution.\n",
    "- [setup_maps_from_rasterdataset](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_maps_from_rasterdataset.html): prepares gridded elevation (bedlevel) from *merit_hydro*. Here elevation is extracted from *merit_hydro* and any no data is filled using *nearest* method. When running, the Delft3D FM kernel will interpolate it to the mesh 2D grid using the *nearestNb* method.\n",
    "- [setup_maps_from_raster_reclass](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_maps_from_raster_reclass.html): prepares gridded Manning roughness and infiltration capacity data from landuse, by reclassifying the landuse categories in *vito* landuse data, using parameters values defined per landuse category in *vito_mapping* table. When running, the Delft3D FM kernel will interpolate it to the mesh 2D grid using the *triangulation* method.\n",
    "- [setup_rainfall_from_constant](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_rainfall_from_constant.html): prepares a constant rainfall rate of *150* mm/day as meteo forcing to the model. \n",

    "- [setup_link1d2d](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_delft3dfm/latest/_generated/hydromt_delft3dfm.DFlowFMModel.setup_link1d2d.html): we will link our 1D and 2D mesh by setting up links from the 1D network to the 2D grid. As you can imagine, this function can only be run once both the schematisation of the 1D and the 2D grids are finalized. If any change is made to the 1D or the 2D grid, this funcion should be run again.\n",

They are identical in this example but one can alter them to have different region for rivers, for pipes and for 2dmesh. This allows the user to customize their model as much as possible, as the extent of the 1D river can differ from the extent of the 1D urban network or the 2D inundation grid. The region bbox are in WGS 84 as required, but the user should specify the dflowfm model destination CRS in the `global` section in order to allow to use grid definition data (rivers, pipes) from different data sources or CRS.
