The command `hydromt export` is not directly related to model building, but used to export data from a data catalog. The command `hydromt check` is used to validate the configuration file and the linked data catalogs and region settings.

    "The basic concepts of accessing HydroMT Delft3D FM using CLI have been explained in this notebook, as well as the contents of a **configuration file** and a **data catalog**. You can now continue to the notebooks where Delft3D FM models will be build using an example configuration file and the artifact data. It is advised to first try building the 1D and 2D models (`build_1dmodel.ipynb` and `build_2dmodel.ipynb`) before moving to the coupled 1D2D model (`build_1d2dmodel.ipynb`)."
