User guide
==========

With the **Hydromt-Delft3DFM plugin**, users can easily benefit from the rich set of tools of the
`HydroMT package <https://deltares.github.io/hydromt/latest/index.html>`_ to build and update
`Delft3D FM Suite <https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/sobek-and-delft3d-fm-suite-1d2d>`_ models from available global and local data.

This plugin assists the Delft3D FM modeller in:

- Quickly setting up a base Delft3dFM model (1D2D) and default parameter values
- Making maximum use of the best available global or local data
- Adjusting and updating components of a Delft3dFM model and their associated data in a consistent way

Two Delft3dFM Model classes are currently available:

- ``dflowfm`` (DFlowFMModel): class for the Delft3d FM flow component.
